# React-Workshop 2018

The all new 2018 tutorial for today's working professional. 

This is the React workshop given at the ACM workshop on 10/2/2018, in this repo I hope to provide resources to prospective instructors and participants to teach/learn about JSX, Components, Events, and Props. That will be satisfactory to get attendees to get started on wokring on their own sample app.

## Objective

This is a React tutorial designed to have slides and code samples built into the presentation while allowing the attandees to pair code along with the instructor on a cloud IDE. We will be using Stackblitz, there will be Incomplete/Complete pairings of each lesson to facilitate each lesson.

This workshop will assume rudimentary knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS but is not nesissary to get something out of this woprkshop.

This repo contains 3 folders

`snippets` contains .mdx files that have code samples used for the presenation

`sample-app` is a React Weather App that in one branch will be half built and in Master will be complete- we will use this section  for live coding

`documentation` will be used to write all the content for the slides before everything is on the `workshop.mdx` file. This will also have speakers notes and general notes on how to approach teaching this workshop.

## Getting Started

If you want to present and run the code samples on your computer.

In project root or `sample-app` run the following commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
