## What JS could do in 2007

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Do cool animations</li>
    <li>Call some server code</li>
    <li>Type errors</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<CodeSurfer
    notes="Nice right?"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/rawjs.js")}
    lang="javascript"

---

Then Node.JS comes out

---

## What JS could do now in `currentYear`

<ul>
  <Appear>
          <li>everything</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

Okay- now to the good stuff.

---

## What is React?

---

## React is...

a JS library that makes it easier to make front-ends. 

It handles what we call 'the View layer' which is everything we see in a web application. 

---

# Before React

- Needed to write HTML templates
- Coupled business logic with view logic
- Other frameworks were very opinionated 

---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="Hello World Before React"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/jshelloworld.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    steps={[
    { lines: [1, 2, 3, 5], notes: "all this" },
    { lines: [6], notes: "just so you can say Hi" }
  ]}
/>

---
### Output

<p>Hello World</p>

---

# With React

- No need to manually manipulate the DOM
- Easier to write reusable code (Components)
- declarative, efficient, and flexible 

---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="Hello World With React"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/reacthelloworld.js")}

React's Secret Sauce

---

# JSX

---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="JSX Before Compilation"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/jsxprecomp.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    steps={[
    { lines: [4,5,6,7,8], notes: "JS Object Detected" },
    { lines: [11], notes: "Notice how we pass the object?" }
    ]
  }
/>
---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="Look ma! A element for every JSX tag we used"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/jsxpostcomp.js")}
    lang="javascript"
/>
---
```
Lets do a thing that drives this concept home.
```
---
Why React is Objectively Awesome
---
We can turn those "small", "isolated" pieces of code that we wrote before into reuseable snippets called 

# Components
---

<CodeSurfer
    notes="Now we dont have to repeat ourselves"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/componentnaive.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    steps={[
    { lines: [1, 2], notes: "Going to create a Component called MessageComponent" },
    { lines: [3, 4, 5, 6], notes: "Notice how we pass an object again?" },
    { lines: [5, 12], notes: "We call this passing the data that is passed into components, Props" },
    { lines: [11, 12, 13, 14], notes: "The best part" }
    ]}
    
/>

---
```

Now websites would be pretty boring without
# Events

---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="Secret Facebook AD code"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/eventexample.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    steps={[
    { lines: [1, 2, 3, 4], notes: "In our component, we have a function that makes us cash money" },
    { lines: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8], notes: "When we click it, we get data, Senator" }
        ]}
/>
---
```
You already know what I am going to ask you.
```
---
So far, we've used React as a static rendering engine. Now, we're going to add

# State

to make our React components more dynamic.
---

<Counter/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Understanding the counter"
  notes="Grokking time"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/state.js")}
  steps={[
    { range: [1, 6], notes: "First, we name the component and set state" },
    { range: [8, 13], notes: "Be mindful that state is just a variable that we manipulate as needed with events" },
    { range: [14, 27], notes: "We can pass in state as a prop, and apply events to most elements" },
    { lines: [17, 20], notes: "This is what makes this demo do things" },
    { range: [1, 32], notes: "➡️" }
  ]}
/>

---

### Cool thing to note
When a component's state changes, render is called with the new state and the UI is updated to the new output. This is the heart of React. We'll take a closer look later.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
