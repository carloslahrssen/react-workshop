  </Appear>
</ul>

<CodeSurfer
    notes="Nice right?"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/rawjs.js")}
    lang="javascript"
/>

Then Node.JS comes out

---

## What JS could do now

<ul>
  <Appear>

## What is React?

---

## React is...

a JS library that makes it easier to make front-ends. 

It handles what we call 'the View layer' which is everything we see in a web application. 

---

# Before React

- Needed to write HTML templates
- Coupled business logic with view logic
- Other frameworks were very opinionated 

---
<CodeSurfer
    notes="Hello World Before React"
    code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/jshelloworld.js")}
    lang="javascript"
    steps={[
    { lines: [1, 2, 3, 5], notes: "all this" },
    { lines: [6], notes: "just so you can say Hi" }
  ]}
/>

---
### Output

<p>Hello World</p>

---

# With React

- No need to manually manipulate the DOM
- Easier to write reusable code (Components)
- declarative, efficient, and flexible

<CodeSurfer
    notes="Hello World With React"

  ]}
